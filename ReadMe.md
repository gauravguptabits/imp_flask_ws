        - connect 
        - disconnect
        - send event periodically. Example ebike speed.
        
    -   To have effective, scalable and maintainable code structure.
    

Assumption

    -   No user authentication
    -   Periodic speed is being by virtual device.


Key Feature

    -   Flask based Socket Server
    -   Virtual device contnuously broadcasting speed.
    -   Configuration driven via environment based config files
    -   Functional/Pythonic approach
    -   Separation of concern via proper directory structure
    -   Dependency management via requirements.txt
    -   Code Reusability via decorator
    -   Support for CORS feature for separate React hosting
    -   File and console based logging
    -   Stubbed Authentication middleware
    -   Virtual environment
    -   Setup
    

Possible enhancement

    -   Deployment using docker.
    -   Deployment using gunicorn.
    -   Unit test
